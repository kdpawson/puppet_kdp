puppet_kdp
==========

My Puppet Project for Ubuntu and CentOS servers including classes for Apache, nginx, mail, ssh, rsyslog and many more. Some modules from the forge include puppetlabs-apt, autoupdate and yum epel repo.

The NTP and SSH classes are OS independent, although limited to Ubuntu and CentOS at this stage i.e. SSH for Ubuntu and SSHD for CentOS.

Other useful items are packages to be installed such as htop, mc, git, vim, byobu and more.

Further documentation to be added shortly.
